# This walk script finds zone 10 and zone 11 shapefiles scattered throughout the directories and copied them into their respective zone 10 and zone 11 folders.  This organized them by zone so I could merge them all together.
# It could easily be adapted to to do whatever you wanted to featureclasses within a directory system. Feel free to modify the code block that "does stuff"
